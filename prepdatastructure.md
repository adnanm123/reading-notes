# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Discussion Questions

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

One of the crucial considerations when choosing a data structure is the efficiency of operations it offers for the specific problem.

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

To avoid infinite recursive call stacks, always have a stopping point in your recursive function, called a "base case." This base case tells the function when to stop calling itself, preventing infinite recursion.
