# Readings: Event Driven Applications

## Event Driven Programming

## What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

The native Node.js module that allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming is simply called events.

## What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) alongside Event-Driven Programming helps in organizing and connecting pieces of code effectively. In simple terms, OOP helps structure code into manageable parts (objects/classes), while Event-Driven Programming lets these parts communicate and respond to specific events like clicks or data updates.Think of OOP as organizing your toolbox, and Event-Driven as using those tools to build things when needed. Together, they make development more organized and flexible.

## Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

Imagine you have a robot chef in your kitchen. This robot can cook multiple dishes at once and clean up as well. When you or your family members ask for food, it instantly starts cooking and serves everyone without making anyone wait. That's like Event Driven Programming in Node.js on the backend. It helps your website or app handle lots of people's requests quickly and do things automatically, like sending notifications or updating information in real-time. It's like having a super-efficient kitchen robot for your online services!
