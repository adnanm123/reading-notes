# Readings: Node Ecosystem

## Review if helpful: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

## How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

Node is like the engine behind many websites and apps. It helps them run fast and do lots of things at once, making your online experiences better.

## What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

Node being a JavaScript runtime means it's a software that lets you run JavaScript code on your computer or server, not just in web browsers. It's like a playground for JavaScript to do all sorts of tasks, not just websites.

## What is Node used for?

Node is like a toolbox for developers. It lets them use JavaScript to build websites, apps, and even control machines. It's like having a Swiss Army knife for coding tasks.
