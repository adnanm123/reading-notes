# Readings: Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## async actions

### Why use Redux middleware?

Redux middleware is used to enable Redux to handle asynchronous operations. When you perform actions in Redux, they are usually processed synchronously, which means the action is sent to the reducer, and the state is immediately updated. However, many operations, especially in web applications, are asynchronous, such as API calls that require some time to complete before you get a response.

Middleware in Redux serves as a middle layer that can intercept actions before they reach the reducer. This allows you to perform additional operations on the actions, like asynchronous API calls, logging, crash reporting, and more.

### Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.

* **Dispatch an Action:** An action is dispatched to signify the intent to fetch data.
* **Middleware Intercepts the Action:** Middleware checks if the action should be handled asynchronously.
* **Async Operations Begin:** If async work is needed, the middleware initiates it (like making an API call).
* **Dispatch a New Action:** Once the async operation is complete, a new action is dispatched with the result (success or error).
* **Reducer Updates State:** The reducer handles this new action and updates the state accordingly.
UI Updates: The state change causes the UI to re-render with the updated data.

### How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?

In accommodating asynchronous operations in our Redux app, we typically use specific middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga. With Redux Thunk, for example, you can return a function instead of an action object from your action creators. This function receives the store's dispatch method, which can then be used to dispatch regular synchronous actions after the asynchronous operation has completed.

By integrating middleware, Redux can handle complex synchronous and asynchronous logic in a predictable way, which is essential for maintaining a clear and consistent state management in complex applications.

## thunk middleware

### Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?

You would need Redux Thunk middleware in your application when you want to dispatch asynchronous actions. This is common when you're dealing with network requests that take time to complete and you cannot update the state immediately.

### Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action.

Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. This function can perform asynchronous operations and dispatch actions when those operations complete.

### Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.

Any return value from the inner function, often referred to as the "thunk," is available by invoking the action creator. When you dispatch the thunk, you can chain .then() on the dispatch call (since thunks can return Promises) and get the returned value from the inner function.
