# Prep Your Mindset

## Assess your emotional intelligence. If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently

After doing the reflection on emotional intelligence activity was that I was pretty good with self-management and self-awareness. Some areas of growth for me would be social awareness and relationship management. I will more than likely have an opportunity in this course to work on these areas as well as learn and develop within these areas. I also have resources such as an instructor, staff, and my peers in this classroom to grow in these areas.

## Assess your biases. If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently

My strongest area is the "Cultivate Connection: Connect to Mitigate Bias" section. I recognize the importance of seeking support and input from others to overcome my biases and assumptions.

In the coming weeks and beyond, I will focus on the "Bias and Identity" section and the "Meaningful Connections" section. These areas will be my primary focus for improvement, as they scored the lowest in the unconscious bias assessment. By examining and addressing these areas, I aim to enhance my understanding of bias and identity and actively seek diverse perspectives to broaden my own.

My weakest area is the "Choose Courage: Effective Courage" section. This indicates that I need to work on confronting bias and creating an environment where everyone is valued. I will make an effort to address this weakness and find opportunities to speak up and advocate for myself and others.

Although I scored between 100 and 120, reflecting high self-awareness, curiosity, and courage, I understand that unconscious bias is an ongoing journey and not something that can be fully mastered. I will continue to examine areas for improvement based on the specific sections where I scored the lowest to further enhance my understanding and mitigate bias.
