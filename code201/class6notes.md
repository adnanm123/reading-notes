# JavaScript Object Basics

## 1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

 An object is like a virtual version of something in the real world. It has characteristics (like its name, color, or age) and can do things (like bark, run, or play). It helps programmers organize and work with complex pieces of code by grouping related information and actions together.

## 2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?

Easy to create: Object literals make it easy and quick to create objects by defining their properties and values in a simple and concise way.

No need for classes or constructors: You don't have to worry about creating classes or constructor functions to make objects.

Flexible and adaptable: Object literals give you the flexibility to define and modify objects on the go, making them perfect for small or one-time-use objects and allowing you to easily make changes as needed.

Readable and understandable: Object literals provide a clear and readable syntax for defining objects, making your code easier to understand for you and other developers.

Lightweight and efficient: Object literals are lightweight and efficient, meaning they don't require extra resources or memory, resulting in better performance.
