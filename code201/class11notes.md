# Video and Audio Content

## 1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s

Using video and audio on the web has changed since the early 2000s. Initially, Flash was commonly used, but now HTML5 provides native support for video and audio without the need for plugins. This has made it easier to play media on different devices and improved compatibility. There are more video and audio formats available, and streaming technologies have enhanced the quality of online media. JavaScript tools allow developers to control and manipulate video and audio elements. Mobile optimization techniques ensure better experiences on smartphones and tablets. Accessibility standards have also been emphasized, making multimedia content more inclusive with features like captions and audio descriptions. Overall, these advancements have made using video and audio on the web more accessible, compatible, and enjoyable.

## 2. Describe the use of the `src` and `controls` attributes in the `<video>` element

The "src" attribute in the `<video>` element is used to specify the video file's location or URL that should be displayed on the web page.

The "controls" attribute in the `<video>` element enables the default video player controls, allowing users to play, pause, adjust volume, and navigate through the video without any additional coding.

## 3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the `<video>` element?

Fallback content is important in the `<video>` element because it ensures that users can still access information or alternative media if the video cannot be played. It improves accessibility and provides a better user experience.

## 4. Write a very short story where `<audio>` and `<video>` are characters

Once upon a time, Audio and Video were inseparable companions. Audio enchanted with its melodious tunes, while Video mesmerized with captivating visuals. Together, they added magic and emotion to our lives, reminding us of the power of sound and image in creating unforgettable experiences.
