# Domain Modeling

## 1. Explain why we need domain modeling

Domain modeling involves creating a code-based representation of a particular problem. It entails designing a conceptual model that defines the entities, their attributes, behaviors, and constraints within the problem domain. In this process, we create object-oriented models where entities store data in properties and encapsulate behaviors in methods.

# HTML Table Basics

## 1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

Tables should not be used for page layouts because they can cause accessibility problems, lack responsiveness, make maintenance difficult, and mix concerns. It's better to use appropriate HTML and CSS techniques for creating page layouts.

## 2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>.`

1. `<caption>`: This element provides a title or description for the table.

2. `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`: These elements group the table header, body, and footer sections, respectively.

3. `<th>`: This element defines header cells within the table, typically used for column or row headers.

# Introducing Constructors

## 1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

A constructor is a special method used to create and initialize objects, providing benefits such as simplified object creation, code reuse, and data integrity.

## 2. How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

In an object literal, the keyword `"this"` refers to the object itself, allowing you to access its properties and methods, while in a constructor, `"this"` refers to the newly created instance of the object being constructed.

# Object Prototypes Using a Constructor

## 1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience

Prototypes and inheritance can be understood through the analogy of a parent passing down their skills and knowledge to their child. Just like how a child inherits certain traits and abilities from their parent, in JavaScript, objects can inherit properties and methods from a prototype, which acts as a blueprint for creating similar objects.
