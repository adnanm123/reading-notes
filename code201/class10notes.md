# Troubleshooting JavaScript

## 1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error

A syntax error occurs when the code is written incorrectly, violating the language's syntax rules. It is like a spelling or grammar mistake in the code. Syntax errors are detected by the computer when it reads the code, and they prevent the code from running properly.
On the other hand, a logic error occurs when the code does not produce the intended results, even if it is written correctly in terms of syntax. It is like a mistake in the logic or plan of the code. Logic errors may not be caught by the computer and can lead to unexpected output or behavior. The code runs, but it produces the wrong output or behavior.

## 2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them

Some errors that I had were having code in different places it wasnt supposed to be which caused errors. Looking at the console I was able to see what was causing the problem and fix it. I also had some spelling issues within my code which also casues to not run.

## 3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Programming teaches you how to think critically and solve complex problems, which is helpful in various fields. Technology also affects our lives in many ways, and having knowledge in this area allows you to make a positive difference in society.

# The JavaScript Debugger

## 1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript Debugger is a helpful tool for beginners in software development. It allows you to pause your code, check variable values, and step through the code line by line. By using the debugger, you can identify and fix errors in your code more effectively, gaining a better understanding of how your code works in the process. It's a valuable tool for improving your programming skills and troubleshooting your code.

## 2. Define what a breakpoint is.

A breakpoint is a special marker in your code that tells the debugger to stop the program's execution at that particular line. It helps you pause your code at specific points to examine and debug it more easily.

## 3. What is the call stack?

The call stack is like a stack of function calls. When a function is called, it gets added to the top of the stack. The function at the top is the one currently being executed. When a function finishes, it is removed from the stack, and the program goes back to the function below it. The call stack helps keep track of the order in which functions are called and ensures they are executed in the right sequence.
