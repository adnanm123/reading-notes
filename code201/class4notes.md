# Learn HTML

## 1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

To create a basic link in HTML, we use the `<a>` element.

## 2. The `href` attribute contains what information?

The `href` attribute in HTML contains the URL for the link's destination.

## 3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

Firstly, use descriptive link text that clearly indicates the destination or purpose of the link. Alternative text (alt text) for images used as links to describe their content or function. Use proper HTML markup by correctly enclosing link text within `<a>` tags and using semantic HTML elements.

# CSS Layout

## 1. What is meant by “normal flow”?

"Normal flow" refers to the default positioning and arrangement of elements on a web page without any special styling or positioning applied.

## 2. What are a few differences between `block-level` and `inline` elements?

Block-level elements occupy the full width available, stack vertically, and create line breaks. Inline elements flow horizontally within a line and do not create line breaks. Block-level elements can contain other block-level and inline elements, while inline elements can only contain other inline elements or text. Block-level elements are better suited for layout and styling, while inline elements are commonly used for text-level elements.

## 3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element

Static positioning is the default for every HTML element.

## 4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element

Using absolute positioning on an element offers advantages such as precise control over positioning, the ability to create overlapping effects, independence from document flow, support for responsive design, and compatibility with animations and transitions.

## 5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

A key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is that fixed positioning elements remain fixed relative to the viewport while scrolling, whereas absolute positioning elements scroll along with the rest of the page.

# Learn JS

A parameter is a placeholder in a function declaration, while an argument is the actual value passed to the function during its invocation.

# Miscellaneous

## 1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey

Pair programming offers benefits such as improved code quality and enhanced learning opportunities. These advantages can help me improve my coding skills, produce higher-quality code, and learn from my partner's expertise during my coding journey. We do an example of this in class during lecture when the instructure is doing code review. We get the oppurtunity of us as students asking for help and all of us going over it together to gain a better understanding. Also another set of pair of eyes to look over your code is better than just yours becasue they might catch something that you missed and vice versa.
