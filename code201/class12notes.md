# JavaScript Canvas

## 1. What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?

The `<canvas>` element allows a developer to create and manipulate graphics on a web page using JavaScript. It enables drawing shapes, text, and images, as well as animating and interacting with the content. It's a powerful tool for creating visual effects, data visualizations, and interactive applications directly within the browser.

## 2. What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?

The closing `</canvas>` tag is important because it properly closes the `<canvas>` element in HTML. It ensures that the code follows correct syntax and helps avoid rendering issues in browsers. It's a best practice to include the closing tag to maintain consistency and compatibility with HTML standards.

## 3. Explain what the getContext() method does.

The `getContext()` method is used with the HTML5 `<canvas>` element to get the drawing context. It allows developers to create a drawing environment on the canvas and provides methods to draw shapes, text, images, and perform other drawing operations. It's a way to access the tools and functionality needed for drawing and manipulating graphics on the canvas.
