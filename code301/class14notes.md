# Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

## What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

The decline of women in computer science began around the mid-1980s, and it happened at the same time as personal computers became popular in homes. These computers were often marketed as toys for boys, and this made it less appealing for girls to pursue computer science. There were also fewer female role models and mentors in the field, which discouraged women from choosing careers in computer science.

## Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

It matters because when boys had more access to computers and technology while growing up, they became more familiar with them. This early familiarity gave them a head start in computer science and tech-related fields. Girls, on the other hand, often felt less confident because they didn't have the same exposure. This led to fewer women choosing careers in tech, creating a gender gap. To address this, we need to encourage girls and women to pursue tech from a young age.

## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

## When are diversity efforts most successful?

Diversity efforts are most successful when company leaders commit to them, understand why diversity matters, and create an inclusive culture where all employees feel valued. Clear goals, diverse representation, fairness, continuous improvement, and external partnerships also contribute to success.

## Why do diverse companies perform better?

Diverse companies tend to perform better because diverse teams bring different perspectives, leading to more innovative solutions. Research shows a positive link between diversity and financial success. Diverse teams can better understand and serve a diverse user base, creating products and services that cater to a wider range of needs.

## Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

Imagine a tech company with a diverse team developing a social media platform. Their diversity helps them understand and address cultural nuances, leading to features that support multiple languages, prevent hate speech, and represent various cultures and identities in avatars and content. This inclusivity attracts a diverse user base and makes the platform more user-friendly and safe for everyone.
