Node.js allows us to run JavaScript code on servers or computers, not just in web browsers. It's like a platform that lets JavaScript work outside of web pages, making it versatile for various applications, including server-side tasks and building web servers.

4. **What is npm?**

npm stands for "Node Package Manager." It is a tool used to manage and install libraries and other code packages for Node.js projects. It makes it easy to add new functionalities to your applications by installing pre-built packages from a vast online library.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

**What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

**In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

In my experience, the most beneficial reason for pair programming is "Learning from fellow developers." It has helped me gain new insights, learn different coding techniques, and improve my overall coding skills by working collaboratively with others.

## How does pair programming work?

In pair programming, there are two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver does the typing and handles the coding, while the Navigator guides and thinks about the big picture. The Driver types, and the Navigator gives directions and suggestions, focusing on overall strategy and problem-solving.
