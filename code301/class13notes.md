# CRUD Basics

## Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

The HTTP method commonly used to update a record through an API is **PUT**.

## Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

**GET**: When retrieving a specific resource, you often specify the resource's unique identifier in the URL to retrieve that specific item.

**PUT**: When updating a resource, you need to specify which resource to update by including its unique ID in the request URL.

**DELETE**: When deleting a resource, you need to specify the unique ID of the resource to be deleted in the URL to ensure that the correct resource is removed.

## Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

* **Create**: To add new data, you use the HTTP POST method.
Read: To get data, you use the HTTP GET method.

* **Update**: To change data, you use HTTP PUT or PATCH methods.

* **Delete**: To remove data, you use the HTTP DELETE method.

**REST** is like a set of rules that helps you use these methods to manage data in web services. It's like a framework for making things work smoothly when you're working with data on the internet.

## If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1. **Plan**: Decide what your API will do and what data it will handle.

2. **Build**: Set up a server and write code for API endpoints.

3. **Test**: Check that your API works as expected using tools.

4. **Document**: Create clear instructions on how to use your API.

5. **Share**: Make your API accessible to others who need it.
