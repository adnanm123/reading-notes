## To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?

In my previous professional setting on a UX Designer team, we had a strong emphasis on psychological safety. Trust, open communication, and respect with empathy were key factors that allowed us to freely share ideas, provide constructive feedback, and support each other, resulting in enhanced innovation, collaboration, and job satisfaction.

This article reinforces the importance of psychological safety in a team environment. It highlights the significance of creating a safe space where team members feel comfortable expressing their ideas, sharing concerns, and offering feedback without fear of judgment or repercussions. Moving forward, I will prioritize fostering an atmosphere of trust, respect, and open communication in my collaborations with others.

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. **Who is Roy Fielding?**
   He helped write the first web servers, which sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

2. **Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**
   The techniques we learn in this class aren't suitable for talking to all machines in the world because they lack the necessary capabilities and specific requirements for such extensive communication.

3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**
   HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

4. **What does a `GET` do?**
   Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP `GET`.

5. **What does a `POST` do?**
   If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of `POST`.

6. **What does `PUT` do?**
   If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of `PUT`.

7. **What does `PATCH` do?**
   `PATCH` does a partial update to another system.
