## Discussion Questions

## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

In my journey towards this career, I believe that my unique perspective, background, and life experiences are what set me apart. They bring a distinctive set of skills, insights, and creativity to the table that nobody else can replicate. This diversity allows me to offer innovative problem-solving and fresh ideas, making me a valuable asset to potential employers.

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

**Break It Down:** When faced with a challenging piece of code or a complex problem, I'll start by breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks. This makes it less overwhelming and allows me to focus on solving one part at a time.

**Seek Help and Collaborate:** I'll remind myself that it's okay to seek help from colleagues, online communities, or mentors. Collaboration and discussing the problem with others often lead to fresh insights and solutions I might not have thought of on my own.
