# My Reading Journal

## Introduction

Hello, everyone! My name is Adnan Mohamud, and I go by the pronouns he/him. I recently graduated from the University of Washington, where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Informatics with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction. As part of my major requirements, I completed a few coding classes, although it has been some time since I last actively used those skills. Currently, I'm running macOS with version number 13.3.1 on my computer. I'm thrilled to be a part of this class as it presents an exciting opportunity for me to broaden my skill set. Software development has always been a passion of mine, but I never had the chance to learn the fundamentals from the ground up. With this program, I'm looking forward to overcoming any obstacles and transforming into a professional in the field.
