# Notes on operators and loops

## 1. What is an expression in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, an expression is any valid unit of code that produces a value. It can be a combination of variables, operators, constants, and function calls, which are evaluated to produce a resulting value.

## 2. Why would we use a loop in our code?

Loops in programming are like a helpful assistant that takes care of repetitive tasks for you. They allow you to easily repeat a block of code multiple times without writing it over and over again. You can use loops to process collections of data, perform calculations, or execute specific operations until a condition is met. By using loops, you can save time and effort by automating repetitive actions and make your code more efficient and concise.

## 3. When does a for loop stop executing?

A for loop stops executing when the condition specified in the loop's declaration becomes false. It repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the condition is true. Once the condition is false, the loop terminates, and the program moves on to the next line of code.

## 4. How many times will a while loop execute?

A while loop executes as long as the condition is true. It continues to repeat the loop's code block until the condition becomes false. The exact number of iterations depends on how the condition is evaluated and modified within the loop.
