# Notes on dynamic web pages with javascript

## 1. What are variables in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. They act as containers that hold information that can be accessed and manipulated throughout the program. Variables allow you to store different types of data, such as numbers, strings, booleans, objects, or functions.

## 2. What does it mean to declare a variable?

To declare a variable means to introduce it in your code and specify its name. It is the initial step in creating a variable before assigning a value to it. When you declare a variable, you are essentially telling the JavaScript interpreter that you want to reserve a memory space to store a value with a specific identifier (the variable name).

## 3. What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?

In programming, an "assignment" operator is used to assign a value to a variable. It is denoted by the equal sign symbol. The assignment operator performs the task of storing a value in a variable.

## 4. What is information received from the user called?

Information received from the user is typically referred to as "input." Input is any data or information that is provided by the user to a program or system. It can include various forms of user interaction, such as text entered into a text field, selections made from a dropdown menu, or button clicks.
