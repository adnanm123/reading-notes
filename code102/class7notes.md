# Programming with Java Script

## 1. What is control flow?

Control flow refers to the order in which statements and instructions are executed in a program. It determines the flow of execution based on conditions, loops, and branching statements.

In programming, control flow allows you to define the sequence of operations or actions that need to be performed based on certain conditions or events. It enables you to control the path of execution and make decisions dynamically within your code.

## 2. What is a JavaScript function?

In JavaScript, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task or calculates a value. It is a fundamental building block of JavaScript programming and allows you to encapsulate a set of instructions that can be invoked and executed multiple times throughout your code.

## 3. What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?

To invoke or call a function in JavaScript means to execute or trigger the code inside the function block. When you invoke a function, the program jumps to that function's definition and starts executing the statements within it.

## 4. What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?

The parentheses in a function definition serve two purposes in JavaScript. First, they are used to declare the parameters that the function accepts. Parameters act as placeholders for values passed to the function when it is called. Second, the parentheses indicate the syntax for defining a function, and they enclose the function's body, which consists of the code that will be executed when the function is invoked.
