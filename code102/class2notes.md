# Notes about the coder's computer

## 1. What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

  When considering a text editor, it's valuable to look for these four features:

 1. Auto-completion for code;

 2. Distinctive syntax highlighting;

 3. Diverse range of themes for reduced eye strain and fatigue;

 4. Access to a wide selection of extensions for added functionality when required.

## 2. What do the following commands do?

- pwd: Stands for "print working directory." It displays the current directory or folder that you are currently in.
- ls: Stands for "list." List the contents of a directory.
- cd: Stands for "change directory." It allows you to navigate between directories. 
- mkdir: Stands for "make directory." It creates a new directory within the current directory. 
- touch: It creates a new empty file.

## 3. Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

- cd projects: This command is used to switch the current directory to the "projects" directory..
- mkdir new-project: This command creates a new directory named "new-project" inside the "projects" directory.
- touch new-project/newfile.md: This command creates a new file named "newfile.md" inside the "new-project" directory.
- cd ..: This command allows you to navigate one level up in the directory hierarchy, transitioning from the "new-project" directory to its parent directory.
- ls projects/new-project: provides a listing of the contents within the "new-project" directory, situated within the "projects" directory. It presents the files and directories found inside "new-project".
