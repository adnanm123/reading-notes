# Notes about revisions and the cloud

## 1. What is Version Control?

Version Control is a system that helps you keep track of changes made to files over time. It allows you to go back to previous versions, see who made modifications, and fix mistakes easily.

## 2. What is cloning in Git?

Cloning in Git is the process of creating a local copy of a repository, including its files and history, to work with on your own machine. It allows you to make changes independently and collaborate with others.

## 3. What is the command to track and stage files?

The command to track and stage files in Git is git add. It prepares files for the next commit by either tracking new files or staging changes.

## 4. What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?

The command to snapshot your changed files in Git is git commit. It saves the staged changes along with a commit message. When you make a commit, it becomes a permanent part of the repository's history, allowing you to track the progression of your project and easily revert to previous states if needed. Commits are essential for collaboration and version control, as they document the modifications made to the files over time.

## 5. What is the command to send your changed files to Github?

The command to send your changed files to GitHub is git push. It uploads your local commits to a remote repository on GitHub, making your changes available to others.
