# Notes on how to structure web pages in HTML

## 1. What is HTML and why do we use it?

HTML is a markup language used for structuring and presenting web pages. It allows you to define the organization of content and control its visual appearance. With HTML, you can create links, format text, and ensure compatibility across browsers. It forms the foundation of the web and facilitates the creation of accessible and interconnected content.

## 2. What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

An HTML element has three main parts: the opening tag, content, and closing tag. The opening tag defines the element, the content is what appears inside it, and the closing tag marks the end of the element.

## 3. What is it called when you give an element extra information?

When you give an element extra information, it's called providing attributes. Attributes in HTML are added within the opening tag and provide additional details or instructions for the element.

## 4. What is a semantic element?

A semantic element in HTML provides meaning and context to the content it surrounds. It goes beyond visual appearance and helps convey the purpose and significance of the content. Semantic elements enhance accessibility and search engine optimization by providing a clear structure to the HTML document.
